# Sketch images asstes manager

The plugin exports all the images available into your document (`images`, `fills images`, `symbol and symbol instances images`).
All the images are automatically added to a new page called `Exportable Assets` and set as exportable.
The Format export settings are set as:

-   "png","1x"
-   "png","2x","@2x"
-   "png","3x","@3x"
-   "svg"
-   "pdf","1x"
